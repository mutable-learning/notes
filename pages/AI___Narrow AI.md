- “Weak AI” is sometimes called “narrow AI”, but the latter is usually interpreted as subfields within the former.
- Hypothesis testing about minds or part of minds are typically not part of narrow AI, but rather implementation of some superficial lookalike feature.
- Many currently existing systems that claim to use “artificial intelligence” are likely operating as a narrow AI focused on a specific problem, and are not weak AI in the traditional sense.
- Siri and Google Assistant are examples of narrow AI, but they are not good examples of a Weak AI, as they operate within a limited pre-defined range of functions.
	- They do not implement parts of minds, they use natural language processing together with predefined rules.
	- They are in particular not examples of Strong AI as there are no genuine intelligence nor self-awareness.
