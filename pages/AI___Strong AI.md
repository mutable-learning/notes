- Strong AI, also known as General AI, is a hypothetical type of artificial intelligence that would have the ability to think, learn, and perform tasks just like humans.
- An AGI could learn to accomplish any intellectual task that human beings or animals can perform
- Strong AI is contrasted with Weak AI, which is a type of artificial intelligence that is limited to a specific or narrow area.
- There is no one agreed-upon definition of strong AI, but it is generally understood to mean an AI that has the following capabilities
	- General intelligence: learn and perform any intellectual task that a human can
	- Self-awareness: aware of one's own existence and capabilities
	- Consciousness: experience subjective feelings and sensations
- The development of strong AI is a challenging task, and there are many obstacles that need to be overcome. One of the biggest challenges is understanding how the human brain works. We still do not fully understand how the brain processes information and learns, so it is difficult to replicate these processes in a computer.
- Another challenge is creating an AI that is able to learn and adapt in the same way that humans do. Humans are able to learn from their mistakes and improve their performance over time. An AI would need to be able to do the same thing in order to be truly intelligent.
- Here are some examples of tasks that strong AI could potentially perform:
	- Write creative content, such as poems, stories, or music.
	- Solve complex problems, such as designing new drugs or developing new technologies.
	- Understand and respond to human emotions.
	- Learn and adapt to new situations.
	- Be creative and innovative.
