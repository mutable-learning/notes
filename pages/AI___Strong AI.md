-
- also known as [[AI/General AI]] , is a hypothetical type of artificial intelligence that would have the ability to think, learn, and perform tasks just like humans
	- learn to accomplish any intellectual task that human beings or animals can perform
- is contrasted with [[AI/Weak AI]] , which is a type of artificial intelligence that is limited to a specific or narrow area
- is no one agreed-upon definition of Strong AI, but it is generally understood to mean an [[AI]] that has the following capabilities
	- General intelligence
		- learn and perform any intellectual task that a human can
	- Self-awareness
		- aware of one's own existence and capabilities
	- Consciousness
		- experience subjective feelings and sensations
- development of Strong AI is challenging
	- one of the biggest challenges is understanding how the human brain works
		- we still do not fully understand how the brain processes information and learns, so it is difficult to replicate these processes in a computer
	- creating an AI that is able to learn and adapt in the same way that humans do is a challenge
		- humans are able to learn from their mistakes and improve their performance over time
		- a Strong AI would need to be able to do the same thing in order to be truly intelligent
- Strong AI could potentially
	- write creative content, such as poems, stories, or music
	- solve complex problems, such as designing new drugs or developing new technologies
	- understand and respond to human emotions
	- learn and adapt to new situations
	- be creative and innovative
