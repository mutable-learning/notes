- Weak AI, also known as Narrow AI, is a type of artificial intelligence that↓
	- is limited to a specific or narrow area
	- is designed to perform a single task or a limited set of tasks
	- does not have the ability to learn or generalize like a human does
	- focuses on mimicking how humans perform basic actions such as remembering things, perceiving things, and solving simple problems
- In John Searle's terms it “would be useful for testing hypotheses about minds, but would not actually be minds”
- Some examples of weak AI include
	- Spam filters
	- Self-driving cars
	- Virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa
	- Recommendation engines
	- Medical diagnosis tools
	- Fraud detection systems
- Here are some of the limitations of weak AI
	- It is limited to a specific task or set of tasks.
	- It cannot learn or generalize in the same way that humans do.
	- It is not creative or innovative.
	- It can be biased or unfair.
- Weak AI is contrasted with Strong AI, which is a hypothetical type of artificial intelligence that would have the ability to think, learn, and perform tasks just like humans
