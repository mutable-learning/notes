-
- also known as [[AI/Narrow AI]] , is a type of artificial intelligence that
	- is limited to a specific or narrow area
	- is designed to perform a single task or a limited set of tasks
	- does not have the ability to learn or generalize like a human does
	- focuses on mimicking how humans perform basic actions such as remembering things, perceiving things, and solving simple problems
- in [John Searle's]([[Searle's Chinese Room Argument]]) terms it “would be useful for testing hypotheses about minds, but would not actually be minds”
- examples of Weak AI include
	- Spam filters
	- Self-driving cars
	- Virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa
	- Recommendation engines
	- Medical diagnosis tools
	- Fraud detection systems
- some limitations of Weak AI
	- it is limited to a specific task or set of tasks
	- it cannot learn or generalize in the same way that humans do
	- it is not creative or innovative
	- it can be biased or unfair
- contrasted with [[AI/Strong AI]]
	- a hypothetical type of artificial intelligence that would have the ability to think, learn, and perform tasks just like humans
