- Sets are an unordered collection of things
- Symbols used with sets to represent different operations
- Use {....} to indicate a set (curly braces)
- **Empty set** is represented with $\emptyset$
- **Compliment** ($A^c$ or $A'$) is all elements that are not in $A$
- **Union** ($\cup$): $A \cup B$ is all elements in A or B or both
- **Intersection** ($\cap$): $A\cap B$ is all elements both in A and in B
- **Set Difference** ($A \backslash B$ or $A - B$): is all elements in A but not in B
- **Symmetrical Difference** ($A \Delta B$): is all elements that are in A or B but not both
- **Subsets**
	- $A \subset B$: is all elements of A are in B, so A is a *subset* of B
	- $B \supset A$ is B *contains* all elements of A
	- Also is written using $\subseteq$ and $\supseteq$
- **Membership**
	- $x \in A$: is element $x$ is a member of (in) $A$
	- $x \notin B$: is element $x$ is not a member of (not in) $B$
