-
- a collection of unordered lists used to represent a finite graph
- each [[List]] describes the set of neighbours ((6515425f-8afb-46c4-bb8e-55d83e780f40)) to a particular vertex in the graph
- allows for the neighbours of any vertex in the graph to be easily listed
- especially useful for a sparse graph, as it is more space efficient than an [[Adjacency Matrix]]
