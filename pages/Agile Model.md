-
- offer a number of advantages over the [[Waterfall Model]], particularly for complex and changing projects
- prefers flexibility, communication, collaboration and simplicity compared to the [[Waterfall Model]]
- two common approaches of agile development are *Scrum* and *Kanban*
- develop software in a series of iterations, or *sprints*, with each sprint delivering a working product increment
- involve the customer throughout the development process
- are adaptive to change, allowing teams to quickly adjust the product as needed
- Agile Model advantages
	- flexible and adaptable
		- are designed to be flexible and adaptable
		- makes them well-suited for complex and changing projects
	- customer involvement
		- involve the customer throughout the development process
		- helps to ensure that the product meets their needs
		- leads to increased customer satisfaction
	- frequent delivery of working software
		- deliver working software to the customer on a regular basis
		- allows the customer to provide feedback and make changes early on
		- delivers value to the customer faster
	- improved team morale
		- are often more enjoyable for team members
		- allow developers to work on smaller, more manageable tasks
		- can see their work come to fruition more quickly
	- reduced risk
		- help to reduce the risk of project failure by delivering working software on a regular basis
		- allowing for changes to the project requirements early on
- Agile Model disadvantages
	- less predictable timelines and budgets
		- are less predictable than the [[Waterfall Model]]
			- as the project requirements can change throughout the development process
		- can lead to longer timelines and higher budgets
	- more complex to manage
		- can be more complex to manage than [[Waterfall Model]]
		- require more frequent communication and coordination between team members
		- developers must be skilled at client communication as well
	- less documentation
		- typically produce less documentation than the [[Waterfall Model]]
		- the focus is on delivering working software
		- can make it more difficult to track progress and identify potential problems
	- not suitable for all projects
		- may not be well-suited for projects where the requirements are very well-defined or for projects where there is a high degree of regulatory oversight
