- Time complexity
	- is a measure of how long it takes an algorithm to run as a function of the size of the input.
- Big \Theta, Big \theta, and Big \Omega are three notations used in computer science to describe the asymptotic behaviour of algorithms. They are used to classify algorithms based on their time complexity.
	- Big O notation is used to describe the upper bound of an algorithm's time complexity. This means that the running time of the algorithm will never be more than the expression in Big\ O notation. For example, the algorithm bubble sort has a time complexity of O(n^2), which means that the running time of bubble sort will never be more than n^2.
	- Big \Theta notation is used to describe both the upper bound and the lower bound of an algorithm's time complexity. This means that the running time of the algorithm will always be between the expressions in Big Theta notation. For example, the algorithm binary search has a time complexity of \Theta(log\ n), which means that the running time of binary search will always be between log\ n and 2\ log\ n.
	- Big \Omega notation is used to describe the lower bound of an algorithm's time complexity. This means that the running time of the algorithm will never be less than the expression in Big Omega notation. For example, the algorithm merge sort has a time complexity of \Omega(n\ log\ n), which means that the running time of merge sort will never be less than n log n.
	- Here are some examples of how Big\ O,\ Big\ \Theta\ and\ Big\ \Omega are used:
		- The algorithm bubble sort has a time complexity of O(n^2). This means that the running time of bubble sort will never be more than n^2.
		- The algorithm binary search has a time complexity of \Theta(log\ n). This means that the running time of binary search will always be between log\ n and 2\ log\ n.
		- The algorithm merge sort has a time complexity of \Omega(n\ log\ n). This means that the running time of merge sort will never be less than n log n.
