-
- we need a way to determine the correctness of an algorithm
- a proof to show the reliability of the algorithm for finding a solution
- this can be demonstrated by using logical and deductive arguments
- two methods for doing this formally are mathematical [[Induction]] and contradiction
- often we will need to state assumptions about the inputs provided to an algorithm
