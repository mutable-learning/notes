-
- formalise processes as algorithms and execute them
- decompose problems into smaller parts that can be solved independantly
- use [[Abstract Data Types]] and [[Design Patterns]] such as [[Iteration]], [[Recursion]], [[Brute-Force]] and [[Greedy]] to create modular algorithms
- recognise common [[Summation Techniques]] that allow for quick identification of algorithmic patterns in problems
