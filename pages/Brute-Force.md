- a very general design pattern that systematically checks all possible candidates to find a solution
- guaranteed to find a solution if it exists
- may not be feasible due to the number of possible combinations tends to grow very quickly as the size of the problem (size of input) increases, known as [[Combinatorial Explosion]]
- typically used when the problem size is limited and the best solution must be found
