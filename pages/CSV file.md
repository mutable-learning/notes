	- is the character used to separate data within a row into columns
	- commonly a comma or tab, but many systems support any character as the delimiter
- works best with data that maps to a row/column relationship well
	- does not work well for data that has a more complex relationship such as parent with multiple children
- no other information is stored in the file to describe the data

- does not work well for complex data or data sets containing varied data
