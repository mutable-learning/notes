- is a thesis about the nature of computable functions
- it states
	- *"a function on the natural numbers can be calculated by an effective method if and only if it is computable by a [[Turing Machine]] "*
- widely accepted by computer scientists, and it is one of the most important foundations of theoretical computer science
- it has been shown that many different models of computation, such as lambda calculus, register machines, and cellular automata, are equivalent to [[Turing machines]] in terms of their computational power
- has several important implications
	- it implies that there are some problems that are simply uncomputable
		- there is no algorithm that can solve them
	- it also implies that any computer program that can be written can be simulated by a Turing machine
- Church stated that *"No computational procedure will be considered as an algorithm unless it can be represented as a Turing Machine"*
