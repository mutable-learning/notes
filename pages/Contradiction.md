- given a statement that you want to prove is true, make an assumption that the statement is false
- try to prove the assumption that the statement is false
- when you show that this assumption is not possible, you have proven that your the original statement is true
- steps to follow for a proof by contradiction
	- Assume your original statement to be false.
	- Proceed as you would with a direct proof to try to prove your assumption.
	- Come across a contradiction.
	- State that because of the contradiction, it can't be the case that the statement is false, so it must be true.
