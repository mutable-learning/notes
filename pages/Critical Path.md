	- is the amount of time that a task can be delayed without affecting the overall project schedule
- it is made up of tasks with [[Project Dependencies]]
	- each task on the critical path depends on the completion of the previous task
- is important to identify the critical path early in the project planning process
	- helps focus your attention on the most important tasks and to develop contingency plans in case of delays
- can change over time as tasks are completed and new information becomes available
	- is important to monitor the critical path closely and to make adjustments to the project schedule as needed
- may be multiple critical paths in a project
	- especially true for complex projects with many interdependent tasks
- the end of the critical path is the current date the project will be complete, and is the best way to estimate when the project will end at any given time
