-
- physically viewing how a currently in-use system operates and is being used
- typically used when designing a system to replace the current system
- useful to help solve the current system's problems
- extensive documentation should be taken during observations
- Observation Advantages
	- provides an unbiased view of current system and practices
	- information does not rely upon being supplied by users
	- multiple locations can be observed as needed
	- multiple users can be observed concurrently
- Observation Disadvantages
	- time consuming and can be expensive
	- may not observe all parts of the system
	- may not occur when the system is under stress or problems are presenting
	- users may be unwilling or nervous to contribute
		- changes in behaviour can skew the data collected
