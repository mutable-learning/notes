- decidable problem
	- a problem that can be solved by an [[Algorithm]] that always returns a correct answer
- undecidable problem
	- a problem for which there is no [[Algorithm]] that can always return a correct answer
- an example of a decidable problem
	- determining whether a given number is prime is decidable
	- there is an algorithm, called the Miller-Rabin test, that can always correctly determine whether a given number is prime
- an example of an undecidable problem
	- the [[Halting Problem]] is undecidable
		- the problem of determining whether a given [[Turing machine]] will halt on a given input
	- no algorithm that can always correctly determine whether a given [[Turing machine]] will halt on a given input exists
- Decidability and [[Tractability]] of problems are two important concepts in theoretical computer science
	- help us to understand the limits of what is possible to compute, and they guide our development of algorithms and software
- generally, decidable problems can be either tractable or intractable
- undecidable problems are always intractable
