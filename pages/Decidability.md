- A decidable problem is a problem that can be solved by an algorithm that always returns a correct answer.
- An undecidable problem is a problem for which there is no algorithm that can always return a correct answer.
- Here is an example of a decidable problem:
	- The problem of determining whether a given number is prime is decidable. This is because there is an algorithm, called the Miller-Rabin test, that can always correctly determine whether a given number is prime.
- Here is an example of an undecidable problem:
	- The halting problem is undecidable. This is the problem of determining whether a given Turing machine will halt on a given input. There is no algorithm that can always correctly determine whether a given Turing machine will halt on a given input.
- The decidability and Tractability of Problems are two important concepts in theoretical computer science. They help us to understand the limits of what is possible to compute, and they guide our development of algorithms and software.
- In general, decidable problems can be either tractable or intractable. Undecidable problems are always intractable.
