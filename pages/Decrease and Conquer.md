-
- used when it's easier to solve a smaller version of the problem, and the solution to the smaller problem can be used to find the solution to the original problem.
- these [[Algorithms]] reduce the size of the input data at each step of the solution process
	- one subproblem is generated each recursion with the input reduced each time
	- [[Binary Search]] is an example of decrease and conquer [[Recursion]]
