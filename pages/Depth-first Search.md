- Traversing a tree or graph
- Start at any node, or the root node (in a tree)
- Explore as far along a branch as possible until a leaf node is encountered
- Backtrack up the branch to the previous branch on the path
- Only difference with [[Breadth-first Search]] is using a [[Stack]] instead of a [[Queue]]]
- Steps to follow
	- Start from root node (random for graph)
	- Set node as seen
	- Check each neighbour node
	- If it hasn't been seen, add it to the stack
	- Add node to list of nodes visited
	- Pop next node off the stack and repeat from step 2
