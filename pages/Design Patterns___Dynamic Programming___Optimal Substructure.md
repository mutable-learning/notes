alias:: Optimal Substructure

-
- a problem has optimal substructure if the optimal solution to the problem can be obtained by combining optimal solutions to its subproblems.
- if you know the optimal solutions to all of the subproblems of a problem, then you can easily find the optimal solution to the problem itself.
- the [[Fibonacci Numbers]] are a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two previous numbers. These can be computed recursively, but they can also be computed using dynamic programming.
