-
- refers to [[Algorithms]] that are self-referencing
- the algorithm calls itself one or more times
- many iterative [[Algorithms]] can be implemented as recursive [[Algorithms]]
- **Base case** is the condition that stops the recursion from continuing endlessly
	- **Terminating condition** is another name for a base case
- once the base case is reached and the simplest version of the problem is solved, all previous versions can be assembled by passing the values back up the stack to the initial call of the algorithm, and the full solution is reached
- *useful when a problem can be broken up into smaller and smaller pieces all of the same problem*
- [[Decrease and Conquer]] and [[Divide and Conquer]] are examples of recursive approaches
