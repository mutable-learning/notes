softdev:: Unit 3 Outcome 2

-
- determine how the [[Functional Requirements]] and [[Non-functional Requirements]] will function and appear in the final solution
- create the [[Solution Design]] to show the functionality, appearance and user interface of the solution
- develop [[Evaluation Criteria]] to compare different [[Design Ideas]] and allow for the evaluation of the final solution once built
	- modify and refine the [[Evaluation Criteria]] as the solution develops
	- test information can also be prepared to ensure requirements will be evaluated by specifying
		- what tests to run
		- what test data should be included
		- what the expected results are
- consider how [[Design Factors]] will shape the final solution
- what makes for a good [[User Experience]] and [[User Interface]]
- use tools to help identify required data and how it will be named, structured, validated and manipulated
	- [[Data Dictionary]]
	- [[IPO Chart]]
	- [[Object Descriptions]]
	- [[Pseudocode]]
	- [[Context Diagram]]
	- [[Data Flow Diagram]]
- design the visual components of the solution including the [[User Interface]] and any reports or graphical representations of data
- use tools to help explore and refine the [[Solution Design]]
	- [[Storyboard]]
	- [[Site Map]]
	- [[Structure Chart]]
	- [[Layout Diagram]]
	- [[Mock-up]]
- update and maintain the [[Project Plan]]
