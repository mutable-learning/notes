softdev:: Unit 3 Outcome 2

-
- there are many different ways to approach a software development project
- models are designed to provide some structure to the process and help ensure a quality end product
- these are known as *Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)* models
- SDLC Models
	- [[Waterfall Model]]
	- [[Agile Model]]
	- [[Spiral Model]]
- there can be many things that influence the accuracy (*effectiveness*) of the solution produced using one of the above development models
- Development Model effectiveness factors
	- choose the *right* development model for the project
		- carefully consider the strengths and weaknesses of each model and choose the one that best matches the needs of the project
	- team member skills and experience
		- working with unfamiliar technologies can cause errors and delays
	- well-defined [[Solution Requirements]]
		- some projects are organic, growing and expanding as new ideas and changes are considered
		- others are rigid and defined from the start
	- good communication and collaboration
		- communication is important between developers and also with stakeholders
		- making sure everyone knows what is needing to be done and helps move the project forward is vital
	- sufficient resources
		- time, money, tools (software and hardware)
		- lack of resources can lead to delays and mistakes
	- [[Risk Management]]
		- there is always some risk in a software project
		- how hard will it be to identify and manage this risk
	- change management
		- there will always be some change
		- some models are better at adapting to change than others
	- testing and integration
		- finding issues early might be important or it might be better to make sure that there is no opportunity for issues to occur
		- is it likely that changes will occur and need to be integrated often
	- client and user involvement
		- users should be involved during the project, but sometimes that is difficult to manage
		- clients may also wish to be heavily involved, or almost not at all
	- post-implementation support
		- after a solution is delivered there may still be bugs that need fixing
	-
