-
- Archiving is used for preserving data that is no longer needed but still valuable to businesses and should be kept for future reference
- it is different from [[Backup and Recovery]] of files, which is used for disaster recovery
- Archiving reasons
	- free up disk space
		- files that are no longer needed by the live system can be archived or disposed of
	- improve performance
		- a large number of files can slow down the performance of systems
			- archiving and disposing of files that are no longer needed may improve performance
	- reduce security risks
		- sensitive data, such as customer data or financial data, should be archived or disposed of securely to prevent unauthorised access when it is no longer needed by the live system
	- comply with regulations
		- some industries have regulations that require certain types of files to be archived for a specific period of time
		- by archiving files properly, businesses can ensure that they are complying with all applicable regulations
- archiving can make use of cheaper [[Storage Media]] options, as the data will not be accessed regularly
- archived files should be stored securely, with all [[Legislation]] requirements followed
- when data is no longer needed it can be disposed of
	- must be done in a secure manner
	- must be removed from all parts of the system, such as live, backup and archived data
	- should be documented to ensure data is disposed of properly
