-
- these [[Algorithms]] divide the input data into smaller subproblems at each step of the solution process. The technique is used when the problem can be naturally divided into smaller subproblems that are independent of each other.
	- Two or more subproblems are generated each recursion
	- Input size reflects the number of divisions
	- [[Mergesort]] is an example of a divide and conquer algorithm
