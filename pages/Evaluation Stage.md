softdev:: Unit 4 Outcome 1

-
- determine the degree to which the final solution has met the requirements
- use the [[Evaluation Criteria]] to evaluate the software solution
- create a strategy to evaluate the solution after implementation
- examine, through the evaluation process, whether the software is an [[Efficient Solution]] and an [[Effective Solution]]
- evaluate the [[Analysis Stage]] processes and the [[Design Stage]] processes and identify any improvements that could be made to the solution by changing the [[Problem-solving Approach]] used
- determine how you can evaluate the solution for meeting the users' needs after implementation
	- specify a timeline for this implementation
	- identify [[Data Collection]] requirements and procedures for this evaluation
	- decide on the [[Data Collection]] methods to use
