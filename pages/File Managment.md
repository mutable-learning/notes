-
- for any substantial project it is a good idea to have a File Management Plan that is comprehensive and understood by everyone working on the project
- this is a document that outlines how all project files will be
	- created
	- stored
	- organised
	- accessed
- helps to ensure that files are properly managed and that all stakeholders know where to find the files they need

		- version control
