-
- files in a project can be managed and used more easily if a known and understood naming convention is used
- File Naming Convention characteristics
	- Consistent
		- files in the project should follow the same naming conventions
	- Descriptive
		- names should be descriptive of the content of the files
			- help developers to quickly identify the files they need
	- Unique
		- names should be unique
			- help to prevent conflicts when saving files
	- Brief
		- names should be as short as possible, while still being descriptive
		- long file names can be difficult to read and remember
	- Portable
		- names should be portable across different operating systems and file systems
- File Naming Tips
	- use a consistent prefix for all file names
		- can help to quickly identify which part of the project a file belongs to
	- use a consistent delimiter to separate different parts of the file name
		- make it easier to *parse* file names and extract information from them
	- to keep track of different versions of a file include a version number in the file name
		- help track of which version of the file is being used and to avoid accidentally overwriting older versions of the file
	- file extensions can be used to provide additional information about the content of a file
	- avoid using special characters in file names, such as spaces, tabs, and parentheses
		- can cause problems when opening and saving files on different operating systems
