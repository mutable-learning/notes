-
- different file organisation methods can affect data access in a project
- File Organisation factors
	- Consistency
		- makes it easier to find and access files, as developers know where to expect to find them
		- can be especially important for large and complex projects with many files
	- Logical Grouping
		- grouping related files together can make it easier for developers to find the files they need to work on
			- grouping all of the source files for a particular component together
	- Granularity
		- granularity at which files are organised can also affect access to data. Some examples could be
			- organising files by project phase
			- organising files by feature
	- Efficiency
		- efficient file organisation can help to improve the performance of the software development process
			- storing files on a fast storage medium can help to reduce the time it takes to load and save files
	- Scalability
		- scalable file organisation means it can grow with the needs of the project
			- organising files by feature can make it easy to add new features to the project
- file organisation is a choice, and each project is different
- common ideas to organise files are
	- by project phase
	- by feature
	- by component
	- by type
- each method has pros and cons, but sticking with one will make things easier for all stakeholders
