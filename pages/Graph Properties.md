-
- Graphs
	- model and capture data in real-world problems
	- use a [[Graph ADT]] to model the problem
- examples of graph problems
	- traffic routes such as flights to major cities
	- GPS routing with or without using toll roads
	- links to web pages in a web site
	- a family tree
	- company staff structures
	- delivery routes
- Vertices
	- are the nodes or objects in a graph
- Edges
	- connect vertices together with a line
	- indicate a relationship between two vertices
- Graphs can be
	- undirected
		- edges have no direction between nodes
		- travel along the edge can occur in either direction
	- directed
		- all edges have a direction indicating the start and end point
		- each edge has an arrow to indicate the direction allowed
- Edges can be
	- unweighted
		- no value is associated with the edge between two nodes
	- weighted
		- edges have a weight value
		- weights represent a value such as distance, cost, time, difficulty etc
- Order
	- is the number of vertices in a graph
- Size
	- is the number of edges in a graph
- Vertex degree (\delta(v) or  degree of vertex)
	- is the number of edges incident to the vertex (the vertex is the end point)
- Isolated vertex
	- is a vertex with no edges (degree zero)
- Distance
	- The number of edges in the shortest path between two nodes
- Eccentricity
	- the eccentricity of a vertex is the farthest distance from it to any other vertex.
	- the eccentricity is the maximum distance in the set of distances between the node and the paths to all other nodes
- Radius
	- is the minimum eccentricity in the set of all nodes' eccentricities
- Diameter
	- is the maximum eccentricity in the set of all nodes' eccentricities
- Central point and Center of Graph
	- a vertex having the eccentricity equal to the radius is the central point
	- the set of all points with the minimum eccentricity is the center of the graph
- Self loop
	- is an edge with the same vertex as the start and end point
- Leaf vertex
	- is a vertex with a degree of one
- Adjacent
	- w is adjacent to v if
		- the graph contains an edge (v,w)

- Subgraph
	- g is a subgraph of G if
		- all the vertices and edges of g are in G
		- each edge of g has the same end point as the edge has in G
- Walk
	- a sequence of any edges and vertices in a graph
- Trail
	- a sequence of any vertices and edges with no repeated edges and starting and ending at different vertices
- Circuit
	- a closed trail, starting and ending at the same vertex
- Path
	- a sequence of vertices and edges with no repeated edge or vertex
- Cycle
	- a closed path, starting and ending at the same vertex
- Connected Graph
	- a simple undirected graph
	- there is a path from any vertex to any other vertex
- Complete Graph
	- a simple undirected graph
	- each pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge
- Complete Directed Graph
	- a directed graph
	- each pair of distinct vertices is connected by a pair of unique edges (one each direction)
- Directed Acyclic Graph
	- is a directed graph with all edges directed from one vertex to another in such a way that a closed loop is never formed
	- can be topologically ordered by arranging the vertices linearly (top to bottom for example) consistent with all edge directions
	- a family tree is an example
