-
- refers to the process of visiting (checking and/or updating) each vertex in aÂ  [[Graph]]
- vertices may be visited more than one time
- tree traversal
	- also called walking the tree
	- visits each vertex in a tree exactly once
- traversing a graph and tree can be done using appropriate [[Algorithms]] such as [[BFS]] and [[DFS]]
- exploring a graph can utilize well-known [[Algorithms]] such as [[Dijkstra's]], [[Bellman-Ford]] and [[Floyd-Warshall]]
- [[PageRank]] is used to determine how *important* objects in a [[Graph]] are
- and [[Transitive Closure]] allows for determining if a path exists between any two vertices in a [[Graph]]
