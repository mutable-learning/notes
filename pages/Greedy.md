-
- an approach that follows the problem-solving [[Heuristic]]Â of making the locally optimal choice at each stage
- may not produce a globally optimal solution but will produce locally optimal solutions that approximate the best solution in a reasonable time
- for example, a greedy approach to the [[TSP]] is "at each step, visit the nearest unvisited city"
