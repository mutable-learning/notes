- a technique designed for problem solving more quickly when classic methods are too slow for finding an exact or approximate solution, or when classic methods fail to find any exact solution in a search space.
- a [[Design Pattern]] utilizing a heuristic will produce a solution in a reasonable time frame that is good enough for solving the problem
	- it may not be the best solution
	- it may be an approximate of the best solution
- heuristic functions may be the only viable option when solving complex optimization problems and are routinely used in real-world applications
- the [[Travelling Salesman Problem]] is an example of a problem that can be solved with heuristic functions that find good solutions
