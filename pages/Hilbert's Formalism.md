- [David Hilbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hilbert) / was a German mathematician who was one of the founders of modern mathematics
	- he developed a formalist approach to mathematics, which views mathematics as a system of symbols and rules for manipulating them
- this approach was an attempt to provide a rigorous foundation for mathematics and to answer the question of whether mathematics is consistent
- Hilbert's formalism had three main goals
	- to axiomatize all of mathematics
		- to express all of its theorems in terms of a small set of basic axioms and formal language
	- to prove the consistency of mathematics
		- to show that there are no contradictions within the axiomatic system
	- to complete mathematics
		- to show that every mathematical statement that is true can be proven from the axioms using a set of steps, or [[Algorithm]]
- Hilbert was successful in axiomatizing many areas of mathematics, including geometry, number theory, and analysis
	- however, he was not able to prove the consistency of mathematics
		- in 1931, [Kurt Gödel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_G%C3%B6del) proved that Hilbert's program was impossible, by showing that there are statements that are true but cannot be proven
	- despite Gödel's incompleteness theorems, Hilbert's formalism remains an important approach to mathematics, helping to clarify the foundations of mathematics and to make it more rigorous
- Hilbert posed the Entscheidungsproblem (decision problem) in 1928.
	- asks whether there is an algorithm that can determine, for any arbitrary mathematical statement, whether the statement is true or false
	- Hilbert believed that the Entscheidungsproblem was solvable, and he thought that its solution would be a major breakthrough in mathematics
- Alan Turing proved in 1936 that the Entscheidungsproblem is undecidable
	- he created the [[Halting Problem]] to prove his work
	- there is no algorithm that can correctly determine, for any arbitrary mathematical statement, whether the statement is true or false
- Hilbert was disappointed by Turing's proof, but it ultimately led to a deeper understanding of the limits of what computers can do through the concept of [[Decidability]]
- brief timeline of the events leading up to the [[halting problem]]
