- David Hilbert was a German mathematician who was one of the founders of modern mathematics.
- He developed a formalist approach to mathematics, which views mathematics as a system of symbols and rules for manipulating them.
- This approach was an attempt to provide a rigorous foundation for mathematics and to answer the question of whether mathematics is consistent.
- Hilbert's formalism had three main goals
	- To axiomatize all of mathematics: to express all of its theorems in terms of a small set of basic axioms.
	- To prove the consistency of mathematics: to show that there are no contradictions within the axiomatic system.
	- To complete mathematics: to show that every mathematical statement that is true can be proven from the axioms.
- Hilbert was successful in axiomatizing many areas of mathematics, including geometry, number theory, and analysis. However, he was not able to prove the consistency of mathematics.
- In 1931, Kurt Gödel proved that Hilbert's program was impossible, by showing that there are statements that are true but cannot be proven.
- Despite Gödel's incompleteness theorems, Hilbert's formalism remains an important approach to mathematics, helping to clarify the foundations of mathematics and to make it more rigorous.
- Hilbert was not able to achieve all of his goals, but his work on formalism has had a lasting impact on mathematics. It has helped to clarify the foundations of mathematics and to make it more rigorous. It is also used in computer science to study the limits of what computers can do.
- Hilbert posed the Entscheidungsproblem (decision problem) in 1928. This decision problem asks whether there is an algorithm that can determine, for any arbitrary mathematical statement, whether the statement is true or false.
- Hilbert believed that the Entscheidungsproblem was solvable, and he thought that its solution would be a major breakthrough in mathematics. However, Alan Turing proved in 1936 that the Entscheidungsproblem is undecidable. There is no algorithm that can correctly determine, for any arbitrary mathematical statement, whether the statement is true or false.
- Hilbert was disappointed by Turing's proof, but it ultimately led to a deeper understanding of the limits of what computers can do.
- Here is a brief timeline of the events leading up to the halting problem:
	- 1928: David Hilbert poses the Entscheidungsproblem.
	- 1931: Kurt Gödel proves that there are statements that are true but cannot be proven.
	- 1936: Alan Turing proves that the Entscheidungsproblem is undecidable.
