-
- the notes and comments written by a programmer within the code itself
- includes information about the program as a whole, including
	- about each of the classes, methods, objects, algorithms, etc. within it
	- combined with using a [[Naming Convention]] to include well-named variables to create understandable and maintainable code
- has no impact on the compilation or running of the code
- exists only to provide context and important information about the code
- most useful when a programmer is reading through code that they did not write themselves, or that was written in the past
	- relying on memory alone or on interpreting complex algorithms to understand what code is doing is hard work
- saves time
	- reduces developer effort
	- more efficiently creating and maintaining software
- good Internal Documentation practices
	- write meaningful internal documentation for your code
		- help you and other developers understand how the code works
	- include
		- file header comments
		- documentation of classes and methods
		- function and subroutine comments
		- single-line and multi-line comments explaining why code is written this way such as
			- to work with another system
			- legal requirement constraint
			- things that aren't immediately obvious just by looking at the code (background)
		- information about testing
		- possibly add extra information on upgrades, changes or enhancements made
			- [[Version Control]] will also house documentation related to code change
	- clear and concise
		- avoid jargon or technical terms that are not specific to the software domain
	- be specific
		- explain less about what code does and more about why it was written this way
	- be consistent
		- use the same style and format for your internal documentation throughout your code
			- follow standard documentation conventions for the programming language
	- keep it up to date
		- if the code changes, the documentation must be checked and updated as well, if needed
