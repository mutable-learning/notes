-
- is the ability of two or more software systems to exchange data and work together seamlessly
- is an important design factor for software systems that need to interact with other systems
	- such as enterprise systems, cloud services, and mobile devices
- different levels of interoperability
	- Data interoperability
		- systems exchange data in a format that can be understood by both systems such as with [[XML file]], [[CSV file]] or [[Text file]] formats
	- Functional interoperability
		- systems work together to perform a specific task
	- Behavioral interoperability
		- systems interact with each other in a predictable and consistent way
- is complex and usually there is no simple solution, but some approaches to help can be
	- use open standards
	- provide well defined interfaces and APIs
	- design for flexibility
