-
- a simple [[Design Pattern]] that marks a block of statements within an algorithm to be read for a defined number of repetitions
- the block is *iterated* or *looped*
- to work successfully, iteration requires that the knowledge of how many times the block will be repeated is known
	- iterate a set number of times
	- iterate while a condition is true or false
	- iterate until a condition becomes true or false
	- this is the main difference between iteration and [[Recursion]]
- loops are the most common structures for implementing iteration
	- ```
	  // A simple iteration pattern using a For loop
	  begin
	  	a = 0
	  	For i = 1 to 3 Do
	      	a = a + i
	      End For
	      Print a
	  End
	  ```
