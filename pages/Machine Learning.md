	- a term used to describe approaches to solve problems that are too 'expensive' to tackle with human-developed [[Algorithms]]
	- the approaches task the machine to discover its own algorithm without needing explicit instructions found in human-developed [[Algorithms]]
	- three common approaches to developing a machine learning algorithm correspond to learning paradigms
