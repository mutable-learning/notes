-
- AI ethics - Transparency
	- how will a person know how an [[AI]] system came to a particular output
	- these models and systems are opaque, to both users and even developers
	- the patterns in data are used but we don't know what these patterns are, as the system itself identifies these and they are not visible to humans
- AI ethics - Accountability
	- who is accountable for the outputs of [[AI]] and [[Machine Learning]] systems?
	- what happens if a system chooses to lie or make a decision humans would consider unethical?
	- should researches and developers be held responsible for constructing systems when something 'goes wrong'?
	- is it reasonable to create systems that advantage some people over others, or harm humans as part of their decision making?
- AI ethics - Bias
	- the systems' decisions are only as good as the data used to train and test it
	- any bias in training data will likely lead to biased output as well
	- if the dataset is used for training systems to make predictions for which it was not designed for, bias may become entrenched in the system unwittingly
- AI ethics - Machine Ethics
	- ethics for machines as subjects, rather than for the human use of machines as objects
	- should the behaviour of systems to humans or even other systems be ethically acceptable?
	- does the [[AI]] need to take into account societal values, moral and ethical considerations, manage priorities of stakeholders and deal with complex contexts?
	- does it need to explain its reasoning and provide transparency?
