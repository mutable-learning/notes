- machine learning models require a high quantity of reliable data in order for the models to perform accurate predictions
- a training data set needs to be targeted and collected as a large and representative sample of data
- training data can be in the forms of
	- a corpus of text
	- a collection of images
	- sensor data
- trained models derived from biased or non-evaluated data can result in skewed or undesired predictions
- bias models may result in detrimental outcomes thereby furthering the negative impacts on society or objectives
- algorithmic biasÂ is a potential result of data not being fully prepared for training
- Overfitting
	- occurs where learning was performed too long or where training examples are rare, causing the model to adjust to very specific random features of the training data
	- the performance on the training examples still increases while the performance on unseen data becomes worse
	- increase the size of the training data set and/or reduce the number of iterations in the training process
- Underfitting
	- is the inverse of overfitting
	- the model or machine learning algorithm is too simplistic to accurately capture the patterns in the data
	- a sign of underfitting is that there is a high bias and low variance detected in the model or algorithm
	- it will work poorly on the training data and any unseen data
	- increase the model complexity, increase the training data set, increase the number of iterations and/or remove noise from the data set
