-
- take a set of data that contains only inputs, and find structure in the data, like grouping or clustering of data points
- the model learns to find patterns in the data without any guidance
- training for unsupervised learning involves iteratively adjusting the model's parameters until it achieves a desired level of accuracy on the training data
- common problems that unsupervised learning can be used to solve include
	- customer segmentation
		- grouping customers together based on their purchase history or other characteristics
	- image clustering
		- grouping images together that are similar to each other
	- natural language processing
		- extracting meaning from text
	- data mining
		- extracting knowledge from data
