- An [[MST]]
	- applies to weighted, connected [[Graph]]
	- is a [[Tree]] , so has no cycles but contains all nodes in the graph
	- is a subset of the [[Graph]] containing all nodes
	- is a tree that connects all nodes with the minimum distance possible
	- There can be multiple MSTs in a [[Graph]]

  *Refer to [[Set Operations]] for help with any of the notation in the above algorithm*
- user [[Prim's Algorithm]] or [[Kruskal's Algorithm]] to find an MST for a graph
