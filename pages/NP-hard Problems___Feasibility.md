- The feasibility of NP-hard problems in real-world contexts depends on a number of factors, including the size of the problem, the available computing resources, and the acceptable level of accuracy.
- For small problems, it may be possible to solve NP-hard problems using brute-force search. However, as the problem size increases, the number of possible solutions grows exponentially, making brute-force search impractical.
- In these cases, it may be necessary to use heuristics or approximation algorithms to find good solutions to NP-hard problems. Heuristics are techniques that can be used to find good solutions to problems quickly, but they are not guaranteed to find the optimal solution. Approximation algorithms are algorithms that can find solutions to problems that are not necessarily optimal, but that are good enough for most practical purposes.
- The availability of computing resources also plays a role in the feasibility of NP-hard problems. As computing power increases, it becomes possible to solve larger and larger NP-hard problems. However, even with the most powerful computers, it may not be possible to solve some NP-hard problems in a reasonable amount of time.
- Finally, the acceptable level of accuracy also plays a role in the feasibility of NP-hard problems. For some problems, it may be sufficient to find a solution that is close to optimal. For other problems, it may be necessary to find the optimal solution. The acceptable level of accuracy will depend on the specific application.
- In general, NP-hard problems are more feasible in real-world contexts when the problem size is small, the available computing resources are large, and the acceptable level of accuracy is not too high.
- Here are some examples of how NP-hard problems are used in real-world contexts:
	- The traveling salesman problem: The traveling salesman problem is a classic NP-hard problem that is used to find the shortest possible route that visits a set of cities. This problem is used in a variety of applications, including routing delivery trucks and planning travel itineraries.
	- The knapsack problem: The knapsack problem is an NP-hard problem that is used to find the most valuable set of items that can fit into a knapsack with a limited weight capacity. This problem is used in a variety of applications, including packing cargo for shipping and selecting items for a shopping list.
	- The Boolean satisfiability problem: The Boolean satisfiability problem is an NP-complete problem that is used to determine whether a Boolean formula is satisfiable. This problem is used in a variety of applications, including verifying the correctness of computer programs and testing the security of cryptographic systems.
- NP-hard problem solutions depend on
	- problem size (brute-force can work for small problems)
	- use of heuristics or approximation algorithms to get a non-optimal solution
	- how much compute resource is available
	- do we need an optimal solution or not (acceptable level of accuracy)
