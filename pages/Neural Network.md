- Neural networks have been around for decades, but they have only recently become popular due to a number of factors, including:
	- Increased availability of data: Neural networks require large amounts of data to train. In the past, this data was not always available, but with the rise of the internet and the increasing popularity of data collection, there is now a wealth of data available for neural networks to train on.
	- Improvements in computing power: Neural networks are computationally expensive to train. In the past, this limited their use, but with the increasing availability of powerful computers, neural networks can now be trained on much larger datasets.
	- Advances in deep learning: Deep learning is a type of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers. Deep learning has been shown to be very effective for a variety of tasks, such as image classification, natural language processing, and speech recognition.
	- Open-source software: There is now a wide variety of open-source software available for training and using neural networks. This makes it easier for researchers and developers to experiment with neural networks and apply them to real-world problems.
- As a result of these factors, neural networks have become a popular tool for a wide variety of tasks, including:
	- Image classification: Neural networks can be used to classify images into different categories, such as cats, dogs, and cars.
	- Natural language processing: Neural networks can be used to understand and process natural language, such as text and speech.
	- Speech recognition: Neural networks can be used to recognize speech and convert it into text.
	- Machine translation: Neural networks can be used to translate text from one language to another.
	- Medical diagnosis: Neural networks can be used to diagnose diseases by analyzing medical images and data.
	- Self-driving cars: Neural networks can be used to control self-driving cars by processing sensor data and making decisions about how to navigate the road.
