-
- consist of input layers, hidden layers and an output layer that contain neurons in each layer and synapses between the neurons
- these layers are created using a [[Perceptron]] structure
- use a process of [[Forward Propagation]] to feed input data through the network in one direction to generate output
- require [[Neural Network/Training]] to understand how the network needs to be adjusted to help predict accurate output
- been around for decades, but they have only more recently become popular due to a number of factors
	- increased availability of data
		- require large amounts of data to train
		- this data was not always available, but with the rise of the internet and the increasing popularity of data collection, there is now a wealth of data available for neural networks to train on
	- improvements in computing power
		- are computationally expensive to train
		- this limited their use, but with the increasing availability of powerful computers, neural networks can now be trained on much larger datasets
	- advances in deep learning
		- deep learning is a type of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers.
		- deep learning has been shown to be very effective for a variety of tasks, such as image classification, natural language processing, and speech recognition
	- open-source software
		- there is now a wide variety of open-source software available for training and using neural networks
		- this makes it easier for researchers and developers to experiment with neural networks and apply them to real-world problems
- have become a popular tool for a wide variety of tasks
	- image classification
		- can be used to classify images into different categories, such as cats, dogs, and cars
	- natural language processing
		- can be used to understand and process natural language, such as text and speech
	- speech recognition
		- can be used to recognize speech and convert it into text
	- machine translation
		- can be used to translate text from one language to another
	- medical diagnosis
		- can be used to diagnose diseases by analyzing medical images and data
	- self-driving cars
		- be used to control self-driving cars by processing sensor data and making decisions about how to navigate the road
