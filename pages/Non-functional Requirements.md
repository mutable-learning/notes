-
- are what the user or client would like the solution to have that don't affect what it does
- generally relate to the *quality* of the solution
	- often opinionated requirements rather than specific targets that must be present
- must be measurable for testable
- usually developed in conjunction with client input
- often closely associated with [[Solution Constraints]]
- Non-functional Requirement categories
	- Usability
		- how easy it is to learn and use the solution
		- clarity of the user interface
		- how intuitive it is you use the system (affordance)
		- measurable in terms of user satisfaction
	- Reliability
		- can it be depended on to function as designed
		- resistance to failure
		- measured as *uptime*
	- Portability
		- how easily it can be used in different environments
		- ease of installation and moving user data between devices
		- ability to use the system on multiple OS/device types
		- use in multiple languages
	- Robustness
		- how well the system responds to unexpected errors when in use
		- error handling techniques
		- relates closely to [[Validation Techniques]] used
		- prevention of user error
		- measured in terms of number of failures/crashes
	- Maintainability
		- how easy it is to keep the software running after it is in use
			- ease of fixing, modifying, installing or changing the software once in use
		- measured by staff hours needed to keep the software running
