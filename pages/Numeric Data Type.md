-
- a type that enables mathematical operations to be performed on data
- two common implementation of numeric data types
- Integer
	- do not support decimal places, only whole number
	- Signed Integer
		- negative and positive whole numbers and 0
	- Unsigned Integer
		- positive whole numbers and 0 only
		- negative numbers are not supported
	- languages can implement different sized integers to allow for efficient versions of the data type to be used when large numbers are not required
	- CPU architecture and OS architecture can affect the maximum size of integers supported on a device
- Floating Point
	- support decimal places
	- consist of a
		- significant
			- the positive or negative digits of the number
		- exponent
			- indicates where the decimal point is placed
	- two common format are single (precision) and double (precision) floating point types
		- less precision is more efficient but trades capability
