-
- known as looping
- repeats blocks of code
	- a set number of times (for loops)
	- based on [[Conditional Expressions]] (while and repeat loops)
- can allow for more concise code to be written
- is often used to process a [[Data Structure]] with multiple data items, when generating output and even performing calculations
- precondition loops such as while undertake the conditional expression first, before the loop is run, meaning the code block inside the loop may not run at all
- postcondition loops such as repeat run the loop at least once before the condition is evaluated to determine if the loop will run again
