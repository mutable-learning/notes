-
- provide instructions to the processor so that a task can be performed
- different programming languages support different programming features
	- most languages support a  common set of features
- features often represent an idea or algorithm, such as repetition or conditional logic
	- [[Processing Feature/Variable]]
	- [[Processing Feature/Instruction]]
	- [[Processing Feature/Sequence]]
	- [[Processing Feature/Selection]]
	- [[Processing Feature/Iteration]]
	- [[Processing Feature/Function]]
	- [[Processing Feature/Class]]
- [[Pseudocode]] is used to describe the ideas and algorithms that will then be created in source code using the language's available features and there are some [[Pseudocode Examples]] available
