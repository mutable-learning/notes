-
- tasks that require the completion of, or are relied upon by, other tasks are said to be part of a dependency
- this implies that there is an order to these tasks and they can only be completed *in order*
- Predecessor
	- task that must be completed before another task can start
- Successor
	- task that must wait for another task to complete before starting
- if a predecessor is delayed or runs over time, all of its successors will also be delayed
- accurate determination of dependencies is vital for an accurate [[Critical Path]]
- on a [[Gantt Chart]], dependencies are shown as a line joining tasks, sometimes with an arrow to indicate predecessor/successor information
