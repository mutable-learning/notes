-
- this is not the same as testing the solution, which should have been done as part of the [[Testing Strategy]]
- it tests how well the solution is meeting the needs of the client and the users
- [[Problem-solving Methodology]] evaluation
	- [[Analysis Stage]] and the [[SRS]]
		- especially the [[Solution Requirements]] and [[Solution Constraints]]
		- was there any [[Scope Creep]]
	- [[Design Stage]]
		- did the design enable the specifications to be met
	- [[Development Stage]]
		- was this able to translate the requirements and design into a working solution
		- how much testing was done
- [[Project Plan]] evaluation

	- examine the documentation for [[Recording Project Progress]] and determine what parts of the plan were impacted and whether these had any impacts on the final solution
		- delays
		- changes
		- resource issues
		- [[Scope Creep]]
		- were there any lessons that could be learned from the process
	- summarise how well the [[Project Plan]] met the needs of the solution
		- was it complete
			- were any significant parts of the project missed from the original plan
			- were annotations added to note this
		- was it easy to maintain
			- could progress be kept up to date
			- could changes be made as needed
		- was it accurate
			- especially for task scheduling
		- was it easy to follow
			- did it make sense and was formatted in a readable manner
	- document your evidence and thoughts into a report about the project
		- explain the advantages and disadvantages of the plan
		- detail lessons learned and changes you would make if you did it again
		- identify further possibilities for developing the solution in the future
- Solution Evaluation
	- occurs after the solution has been in use for some time
		- too early and the users haven't had time to adjust to the new solution
		- too long and the resentment with issues may build up or any issues may become too serious
	- use the [[Evaluation Criteria]] documented during the [[Design Stage]] that evaluate the criteria for ((6549941c-5ec6-4bfc-8218-f98e468b3528)) and  ((6549941c-7d9e-4393-b5a2-2352cdfb3fea))
		- conduct interviews with users
		- survey users with questions for the criteria
		- collect system data relating to the ((6549941c-5ec6-4bfc-8218-f98e468b3528)) from logs and system monitoring
		- make observations of the solution in use and include screenshots and recordings
	- for each criterion in the [[Evaluation Criteria]] there must be a method of evaluating it listed and the results
		- to what degree has the criterion been met or satisfied
		- are the measurements subjective or objective
