-
- to ensure a software project is successful the following are needed
	- determine needed
		- tasks
		- people
		- resources
		- time
	- organise and schedule these
	- monitor the progress of these as the project progesses
- a [[Gantt Chart]] can be a useful way to document a project
- Milestones
	- mark the achievement of a significant amount of the project
	- all tasks that are part of a milestone have completed
	- does not have a duration on a [[Gantt Chart]]
	- usually represented with a diamond
- Dependencies
	- if a task relies on the completion of another task before it can be completed this creates a *dependency*
	- implies an order to the scheduling and completion of tasks
- Tasks
	- the actual work that needs to be completed
	- should be broken down into logical blocks that are
		- achievable
		- easy to understand
		- easy to schedule and assign resources to
- Slack Time
	- the amount of time a task can be delayed without affecting the timing of any other task or the overall completion time
- Critical Path
	- the sequence of tasks in a project which
		- contains no slack time
		- is the longest duration
		- is the minimum possible time the project will take to complete
	- any delay of completion for a task on the critical path will delay the project
