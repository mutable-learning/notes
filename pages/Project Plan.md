-
- to ensure a software project is successful the following are needed
	- determine needed
		- tasks
		- people
		- resources
		- time
	- organise and schedule these
	- monitor the progress of these as the project progesses
- a [[Gantt Chart]] can be a useful way to document a project
- Resources
  id:: 6543174f-65ba-433a-9085-39781bad1d0e
	- people, equipment, buildings etc
	- can be scheduled to tasks and be tracked as part of the project
- Tasks
  id:: 654313e6-ee49-4f8a-b646-8b3471c115d2
	- the actual work that needs to be completed
	- should be broken down into logical blocks that are
		- achievable
		- easy to understand
		- easy to schedule and assign resources to
- Dependencies
  id:: 65431376-176d-4df3-a153-9e1c627226ce
	- if a task relies on the completion of another task before it can be completed this creates a *dependency*
	- implies an order to the scheduling and completion of tasks
	- a line from the parent task with an arrow pointing to the dependant task is displayed on the [[Gantt Chart]]
- Milestones
  id:: 65431229-e586-4070-9674-a83cac1a7365
	- mark the achievement of a significant amount of the project
	- all tasks that are part of a milestone have completed
	- does not have a duration on a [[Gantt Chart]]
	- usually represented with a diamond
- Slack Time
  id:: 65431573-36ef-41ba-ae23-f54a1d5f9c21
	- the amount of time a task can be delayed without affecting the timing of any other task or the overall completion time
- Critical Path
  id:: 654314d5-56c3-48ce-9334-b54132510490
	- the sequence of tasks in a project which
		- contains no slack time
		- is the longest duration
		- is the minimum possible time the project will take to complete
	- any delay of completion for a task on the critical path will delay the project
	-
