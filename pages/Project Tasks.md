-
- these are the parts of the project that describe the work that must be completed
- can be simple to complex, but ideally will be small enough so that they are manageable and achievable
- more complex tasks can be broken up into subtasks
	- think of a task and then try to disassemble it into component parts
	- if any of these parts can be disassembled into their component parts do this
	- continue thinking of tasks and breaking them up into their smaller, achievable, non-trivial component parts until you have listed all the tasks that are needed for the project
- tasks should be easy to understand, easy to schedule and/or assign any ((6543174f-65ba-433a-9085-39781bad1d0e)) to
- if you have a task that can't be completed as part of it is delayed whilst other parts are already finished, it would be a good candidate for making into smaller separate tasks so that they can be scheduled and monitored individually
- tasks usually result in a measurable result that is non-trivial
	- document all constraints in SRS (good)
	- add button to interface (trivial)
- once all tasks are identified they need to have an estimated duration given to them
	- how long will it take to complete the task
- tasks that make use of resources that are being tracked as part of the project also need to have these assigned to them so that tasks that require the same resource are not scheduled at the same time
- think about what tasks can run at the same time and schedule appropriately
- any tasks that rely on the completion of another task before they can begin have [[Project Dependencies]] that need to be considered carefully
