-
- is an equation that calculates a term by using the previous term(s)
- uses an initial or seed value(s) to start the recurrence
- Steps to create a recurrent relation for a recursive algorithm
	- Identify the base case
		- the case where the recursive algorithm does not need to call itself
		- the base case for the [[Fibonacci Numbers]] sequence is when the input is 0 or 1
	- Identify the recursive step
		- where the recursive algorithm calls itself
		- the recursive step for the [[Fibonacci Numbers]] sequence is to
			- calculate the Fibonacci numbers for the input minus 1 and the input minus 2
			- then add the two results together
	- Write the recurrence relation
		- an expression that describes the running time of the recursive algorithm
		- will usually have the following form
			- $T(n) = a * T(n/b) + c$  where
				- $T(n)$ is the running time of the recursive algorithm on input $n$
				- $a$ is a constant that represents the time it takes to do the recursive step
				- $c$ is a constant that represents the time it takes to do the base case
				- $b$ is a constant that represents the size of the input after the recursive step
		- in VCE Algorithmics we only are concerned with recurrent relations of the form
			- $T(n) = \sum {^k_{i=1}}\ T(n-a_i)+b\ \text{where}\ a_i\in N$
				- $T(n)$ is the running time of the algorithm
				- $k$ is a constant
				- $a_i$ are the set of integers that are not all equal to each other
				- $b$ is a constant that represents the time it takes to do the base case
				- $N$ represents the input size
	- Solve the recurrence relation
		- use the [[Master Theorem]]
		- another way is to use back substitution
- Here is an example of how to create a recurrent relation for the [[Fibonacci Numbers]] sequence
	- the base case for the Fibonacci sequence is when the input is 0 or 1
	- the recursive step is to calculate the [[Fibonacci Numbers]] for the input minus 1 and the input minus 2, and then add the two results together
	- the recurrence relation for the Fibonacci sequence is
		- $T(n) = T(n-1) + T(n-2)$
	- solve using the [[Master Theorem]]
		- the solution is that $T(n)$ is $O(φ^n)$, where $φ$ is the golden ratio
		- a looser upper bound would be $O(2^n)$
