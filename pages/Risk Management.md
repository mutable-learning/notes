- threats to data and systems are a constant and must be managed effectively and there are three categories of these that must be considered and minimised ( ((65718797-21ee-420b-b49d-befd0c9e975f)) )
	- ((65718797-7672-45da-bb63-2c6c4aa27597))

- measures need to be put into place to minimise the risk of threats
	- it is very difficult or even impossible to remove the risk of all threats
	- a balance must be found between the level of risk and using the system or data, known as [[Risk Appetite]]
- [[Unacceptable Risk]] must be determined and then measures can be implemented to counter this
- [[Software Auditing and Testing]] to reduce the risk of impact of any issues and reduce the possibility of issues arising
- managing the risk of [[Third Party Software]]
- practices aimed at [[Minimising Security Vulnerabilities]] when developing software and using systems
- ensuring any data used maintains [[Data Integrity]] and the impacts of ineffective strategies to protect data
- develop criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of software development [[Security Strategies/Evaluation Criteria]]
- what makes up a [[Risk Management Plan]]
