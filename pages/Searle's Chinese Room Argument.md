- Searle's thought experiment begins with this hypothetical premise
	- suppose that artificial intelligence research has succeeded in constructing a computer that behaves as if it understands Chinese.
	- it takes Chinese characters as input and, by following the instructions of a computer program, produces other Chinese characters, which it presents as output
	- this computer performs its task so convincingly that it comfortably passes the Turing test
	- it convinces a human Chinese speaker that the program is itself a live Chinese speaker
	- it makes appropriate responses to any question asked, such that any Chinese speaker would be convinced that they are talking to another Chinese-speaking human being
- The question Searle wants to answer is this: does the machine literally "understand" Chinese? Or is it merely simulating the ability to understand Chinese?
	- Searle calls the first position Strong AI and the latter Weak AI.
- Searle then supposes that
	- he is in a closed room and has a book with an English version of the computer program, along with sufficient papers, pencils, erasers, and filing cabinets
	- he could receive Chinese characters through a slot in the door, process them according to the program's instructions, and produce Chinese characters as output, without understanding any of the content of the Chinese writing
	- if the computer had passed the Turing test this way, it follows, says Searle, that he would do so as well, simply by running the program manually
- Searle asserts that there is no essential difference between the roles of the computer and himself in the experiment.
- Each simply follows a program, step-by-step, producing behaviour that is then interpreted by the user as demonstrating intelligent conversation.
- However, Searle himself would not be able to understand the conversation, therefore, he argues, it follows that the computer would not be able to understand the conversation either.
- Searle argues that, without "understanding" (or "intentionality"), we cannot describe what the machine is doing as "thinking" and, since it does not think, it does not have a "mind" in anything like the normal sense of the word. Therefore, he concludes that the "strong AI" hypothesis is false.
