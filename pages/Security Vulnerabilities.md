-
- maintain awareness of vulnerabilities that may impact a current or future solution
- there are three categories of common vulnerabilities
	- insiders (staff and users)
	- technical attacks ([[Malware]])
	- psychological attacks ([[Social Engineering]])
- employees and insiders are commonly the source of many attacks and security incidents
- **Security Vulnerability Types**
	- Back Door
		- hidden unauthorised access feature included by developers or installed by malware
	- Brute Force Attack
	  id:: 657187a3-e15c-40f9-8c4f-f0b59f6a01eb
		- guessing passwords until authentication is achieved
		- a password dictionary with common passwords or known breach info may also be used
	- Cache Poisoning
	  id:: 657114ff-8a54-458f-b1d9-60e0356d5798
		- data in core systems, such as DNS, is replaced with false information to exploit systems that trust and use the poisoned systems
	- DOS and DDOS
	  id:: 657187a3-ee63-45c3-b335-5b3485b81d2f
		- sending overwhelming connection request to a service to block access
	- Keylogging
		- hidden software that monitors all keyboard and/or mouse movement and exfiltrates this data to an attacker
	- Mail Bombing
		- massive amounts of email sent to target
	- [[Malware]]
		- different kinds of attacks that exploit code and system errors
	- [[Man-in-the-middle Attack]]
		- intercepting data by inserting the attack in-between two systems transferring data
	- Ransomware
		- encrypts an entire device making it unusable unless a ransom is paid to gain the decryption key
	- Rootkit
		- parts of OS or BIOS code are replaced/extended to allow persistent unauthorised access
	- Sniffing
		- hidden monitoring and collection of data transmitted over a network
	- Spear Phishing
	  id:: 65711661-3fe9-42e3-85e8-6361aaa05343
		- targeted [[Social Engineering]] attack on particular individuals
	- Spoofing
		- fooling a target system or computer into trusting an attacker by pretending to be a trusted system
	- [[Web Application Risks]]
		- there are a variety of risks attackers exploit when web applications are used in a solution
