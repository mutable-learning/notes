-
- consider and address security threats and risks early in the solution design
- is especially important for systems that handle sensitive data or that are critical to business operations
- Security approaches to design
	- conduct threat modelling to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities
	- implement best security practices in code such as using [[Validation Techniques]] and secure coding practices
	- design to be resilient to attack, even if one occurs
	- allowing for system monitoring and easy patching when attacks occur
- Security influencing design
	- using encryption to protect sensitive data
	- implementing authentication and authorisation mechanisms to control user access
	- detecting and responding to security threats and incidents
	- using secure transmission protocols
	- sanitising all input to resist common attacks such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting
