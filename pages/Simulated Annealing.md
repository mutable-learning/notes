- is a [[heuristic]] optimization algorithm that is inspired by the annealing process in metallurgy
	- annealing is a process of heating a metal to a high temperature and then slowly cooling it down
	- allows the metal to reach a more stable state with fewer defects
- starts with a random solution to a problem and then iteratively improves the solution by making small changes, similarly to [[Hill Climbing]]
- unlike other optimization algorithms, simulated annealing also allows the solution to get worse at some points
	- is done with a probability that decreases as the algorithm progresses
- by allowing the solution to get worse at some points, the algorithm is more likely to find a Global Optimum rather than a Local Optimum
- an example of how simulated annealing use
	- we want to find the shortest path between two points on a map
		- represent the map as a graph
			- each node represents a point on the map
			- each edge represents a connection between two points
	- start with a random path between the two points
	- iteratively improve the path by making small changes
		- such as swapping two edges in the path or add a new edge
	- the algorithm would also allow the path to get worse at some points
		- done with a probability that decreases as the algorithm progresses
		- probability of allowing the path to get worse is initially high
			- it decreases as the algorithm gets closer to the global optimum
	- continue to improve the path until it reaches a point where it is very unlikely to find a better path
		- the algorithm would stop and return the path
- probability of accepting a worse solution decreases as the algorithm progresses
	- the algorithm is more likely to be near the Global Optimum as it progresses
	- therefore less likely to find a better solution by accepting a worse solution
- probability of accepting a worse solution is usually defined as a function of the temperature of the system
	- temperature of the system is a measure of how likely the algorithm is to accept a worse solution
	- temperature is initially high
		- the algorithm is more likely to accept worse solutions
	- as the algorithm progresses, the temperature decreases
		- less likely to accept worse solutions
	- temperature is usually decreased exponentially
		- decreases by a constant factor at each step
		- usually chosen to be between 0.5 and 0.9
- decreasing probability of accepting a worse solution
	- helps to ensure that the algorithm does not get stuck in a local optimum
		- if the probability of accepting a worse solution was always high, the algorithm would be more likely to get stuck in a local optimum
	- helps to ensure that the algorithm terminates in a reasonable amount of time
		- If the probability of accepting a worse solution was always high, the algorithm could potentially continue to run forever, searching for a better solution that does not exist
