-
- include security as an intrinsic parts of the [[Design Stage]] and [[Development Stage]]
- use [[Version Control]] to track all changes
	- have procedures to ensure things like encryption keys and access tokens are kept out of version control systems
- use [[User Authentication]] and [[User Authorisation]] to access software resources and code
- develop criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of software development security strategies

	- define clear and measurable security goals and objectives for the solution
	- determine how you are going to measure the effectiveness of the strategies
		- what should be measured: number of vulnerabilities, number of attacks, time to respond
	- conduct regular audits of practices
	- monitor and analyse how well practice is meeting the criteria
- follow secure development practices
	- avoid 'temporary' code that is added to meet deadlines and requirements
	- use [[Validation Techniques]] on all inputs
	- use secure data storage techniques, such as encryption
	- use secure communication protocols, such as HTTPS
	- use effective error handling techniques (no unhandled exceptions)
	- log important actions and monitor logs
- use encryption to protect data and sensitive code from unauthorised access
- ensure software tools used are kept up to date and configured correctly
- follow other measures to help minimise risk and ensure [[Software Security]]
