-
- the final design for the solution that will be created in the [[Development Stage]] of the [[Problem-solving Methodology]]
- this is the culmination of all the work undertaken in the [[Design Stage]] and, together with the [[Evaluation Criteria]] is given to the developers to build
- the solution design will have been generated by
	- examining the [[Solution Scope]], [[Solution Constraints]] and [[Solution Requirements]] from the [[SRS]]
	- detailed information will be gathered on users and their needs during the [[Data Collection]] process
	- this data will be examined and considered as [[Design Ideas]] are generated and tested
	- these [[Design Ideas]] will then be evaluated against the [[Evaluation Criteria]] to determine how well they meet the requirements for the system
	- based on the results, the ideas will be added and discarded until a final design is determined
- the solution design needs to be clear and detailed, so that developers, who may not have been involved in the design of the project, are able to understand the design and build it as specified
