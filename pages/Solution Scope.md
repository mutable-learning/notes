	- what will not be part of the solution (specific exclusions)

- if a requirement is not included in the scope it is not part of the solution
- if a requirement is specifically mentioned to not be part of the scope, it will not be part of the [[Solution Design]] and will not be part of the finished solution
- changes to the scope must be carefully monitored for impacts on the [[Project Plan]] and may result in [[Scope Creep]] when not managed effectively
