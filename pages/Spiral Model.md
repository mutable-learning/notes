-
- a good choice for complex and changing projects where risk mitigation is important
	- is particularly well-suited for projects where the requirements are not well-defined or where the project is likely to change over time
- is an iterative and incremental methodology like the [[Agile Model]]
	- software is developed in a series of cycles
	- each cycle delivering a working product that can be used and evaluated by the customer
- involves the customer throughout the development process
- Spiral Model advantages
	- flexible and adaptable
		- is a flexible and adaptable methodology, which makes it well-suited for complex and changing projects
	- risk-driven
		- emphasises risk analysis and mitigation
		- helps to reduce the risk of project failure
	- early customer involvement
		- involves the customer throughout the development process
		- helps to ensure that the product meets their needs
	- incremental delivery of working software
		- delivers working software to the customer on a regular basis
		- allows the customer to provide feedback and make changes early on
- Spiral Model disadvantages
	- complex to manage
		- can be complex to manage, as it requires careful planning and execution of each spiral loop
	- time-consuming
		- can be more time-consuming than other methodologies, as it involves more iterations and risk analysis
	- expensive
		- can be more expensive than other methodologies, as it requires more resources to manage and execute
