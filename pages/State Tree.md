- A State Tree is a graphical representation of the possible states and actions in a problem.
- It may be an actual [[Tree]] or it may be a [[Graph]]
- Each node in the tree corresponds to a state, and each edge corresponds to an action that changes the state.
- The root node is the initial state, and the goal node is the desired state.
- State trees are useful for solving problems that involve **searching**, **planning**, or **decision making**.
	- For example, state trees can be used to find the optimal way to cross a bridge, play a game of chess, or navigate a maze.
- State trees can also be used to model the behavior of agents, such as humans, animals, or robots, in different environments and scenarios.
- In artificial intelligence, state trees are used to represent the possible states of the environment and the actions that the agent can take.
- In robotics, state trees are used to represent the possible configurations of the robot and the actions that the robot can take to move between configurations.
- In software engineering, state trees are used to represent the possible states of a software system and the events that can cause the system to transition from one state to another.
- State trees can vary in size and complexity depending on the problem and the number of possible states and actions.
- Some state trees may be finite and complete, while others may be infinite or partial.
