-
- when choosing storage medium for a software project there are a number of factors to consider that can affect access to data
- common storage media are
	- Hard Disk Drives (HDDs)
		- cheap, big but slow
	- Solid State Drives (SSDs)
		- fast but smaller and more expensive than HDDs
	- Network Attached Storage (NAS)
		- are specialised storage devices that can be accessed over a network
		- NAS devices can be used to store and share software project files with multiple users within the network
	- Cloud Storage
		- convenient and can be accessed from anywhere with an internet connection
- Data Access and Storage Media factors
	- Speed
		- will determine how quickly data can be read and written
			- SSDs are the fastest, followed by NAS devices, and then HDDs
			- Cloud storage services can vary in speed depending on the service provider and the internet connection
	- Latency
		- the time it takes for the storage medium to respond to a request
			- SSDs have the lowest latency, followed by NAS devices, and then HDDs
			- Cloud storage services can have higher latency
				- depending on the distance between the user and the data centre
	- Availability
		- the percentage of time that the storage medium is available for use
			- SSDs and NAS devices are very reliable, while HDDs can be more prone to failure
			- Cloud storage services are also very reliable, but they can be affected by internet outages
	- Cost
		- cost of storage can vary depending on the storage medium and the amount of storage space required
			- SSDs are the most expensive, followed by NAS devices, and then HDDs
			- Cloud storage services can also vary in cost depending on the service provider and the amount of storage space required
				- can become expensive for large projects but can also be cheap when needs are small
	- Security
		- is important to consider if you are storing sensitive data
			- SSDs and NAS devices can be encrypted to protect data from unauthorised access
				- Cloud storage services also offer a variety of security features
					- important to choose a service provider that has a good reputation for security
	- Scalability
		- the ability of the storage medium to grow with your needs
			- SSDs and NAS devices can be scaled up by adding more storage drives
			- Cloud storage services are also very scalable, as you can simply add more storage space as needed
