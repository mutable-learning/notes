- Use the techniques below to analyse algorithms for patterns
- **Gauss Sum Formula**: All positive integers from $1 \dots n$
	- $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ can also be written as below
	- $\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{i}i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$
- **Even number sum formula**: Sum the first $n$ positive even numbers
	- $n(n+1)$ can also be written as below
	- $\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n}2i = 2\sum_{i=1}^{n}i = n(n+1)$
- **Odd number sum formula**: Sum the first $n$ positive odd numbers
	- $n^2$ can also be written as below
	- $\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n}(2i-1)=n^2$
- **Positive powers of 2 sum formula**: Sum the first $n$ powers of 2
	- $2^{n}-1$ can also be written as below
	- $\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}2^i = 2^{n}-1$
