-
- these algorithms build a mathematical model of a set of data that contains both the inputs and the desired outputs
	- this data is known as Training Data
	- each piece of training data has one or more inputs and the desired output
- by iteratively running over the training data and making adjustments each time, the model learns a function that can be used to predict the output for new inputs
	- an optimal function allows the algorithm to correctly predict outputs for inputs that were not part of the training data
- useful for problems involving
	- classification

		- to classify data into categories
		- for example, to classify images of animals into different species
	- regression
		- to predict a continuous value
		- for example, to predict the price of a house based on its features
