-
- there are many parts of a software project that require proof that they meet the specifications outlined in the [[SRS]]
- testing is done at various stages throughout the [[Problem-solving Methodology]], but much of it happens in the [[Development Stage]] and the [[Evaluation Stage]]
- Testing Plan
	- is a document that describes how a software project will be tested
	- outlines the scope of the testing, the test objectives, the test strategy, the test schedule, the test resources, and the risk assessment
	- should define what will be tested and what will not be tested
	- should also specify the different types of testing that will be performed
	- should define what the testers are trying to achieve, such as finding bugs, assessing requirements etc
	- should define the start and end dates for each phase of the testing
	- should identify the people, skills, and tools that will be needed for the testing
	- should identify the people, skills, and tools that will be needed for the testing
- testing involves the use of
	- Test Cases
		- specific tests that are designed to verify that the software meets the requirements
	- [[Test Data]]
	- Test Environment
		- the hardware and software that is used to perform the tests
	- Defect Management
		- the process of tracking and fixing bugs
	- Reporting
		- how the test results will be reported to the stakeholders
- Testing Types
	- | Type of testing | Purpose |
	  |---|---|---|
	  | [[Unit Testing]] | test individual units of code to verify that they work as expected |
	  | Integration testing | test the interactions between different units of code to verify that they work together as expected |
	  | System testing | test the entire software system to verify that it meets the requirements and that it works as expected |
	  | Acceptance testing | test the software system with the customer to verify that it meets their needs and expectations |
	  | Performance testing | measure the performance of the software system under load |
	  | Security testing | identify and fix security vulnerabilities in the software system |
	  | Accessibility testing | verify that the software system is accessible to users with disabilities |
	  | [[Usability Testing]] | evaluate the usability of the software system and to identify areas where it can be improved |
- White box testing
	- is done by a tester who knows the internal workings of the software
	- aims to test sections of code, algorithms and methods
- Black box testing
	- is done by a tester who knows nothing about the internal working of the system
	- focusses on testing inputs and outputs
- a process must be included in the plan for [[Documenting Test Results]]
