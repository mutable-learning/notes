- Polynomial time
	- is a measure of how long an algorithm takes to run, as a function of the size of the input data.
	- an algorithm is said to be polynomial-time if its running time is upper bounded by a polynomial expression in the size of the input for the algorithm
		- $T(n) = O(n^k)$ for some positive constant $k$
	- are considered to be efficient, because they can solve problems that grow large in size in a reasonable amount of time.
- P problems
	- can be solved in polynomial time
	- the time it takes to solve the problem grows as a polynomial function of the size of the input data
	- are considered to be "easy" to solve.
	- a problem belongs to class P if itâ€™s easy to find a solution for the problem and can be solved and verified in polynomial time
- NP problems
	- can be verified in polynomial time
	- given a solution to the problem, it can be checked in polynomial time to see if the solution is correct
	- considered to be "hard" to solve, because even though they can be verified quickly, they can be very time-consuming to find a solution for
	- are problems that can be solved by guessing the solution and then verifying it in polynomial time
- NP-hard problems
	- are at least as hard as any NP problem
	- if there is an algorithm that can solve an NP-hard problem in polynomial time, then there would also be an algorithm that can solve any NP problem in polynomial time
	- are considered to be the "hardest" problems to solve
- NP-complete problems
	- are both NP-hard and NP
	- they are at least as hard as any NP problem, and they can also be verified in polynomial time
	- a problem for which any proposed solution can be quickly verified to be correct, but for which finding a solution in the first place is difficult
