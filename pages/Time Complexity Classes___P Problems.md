- P problems are those that can be solved in polynomial time. This means that the time it takes to solve a P problem grows as a polynomial function of the size of the input.
- Here are some of the characteristics of P problems:
	- Polynomial timeâ†“
		- The time it takes to solve a P problem grows as a polynomial function of the size of the input. This means that the time it takes to solve a P problem can be expressed as a polynomial of the form n^c, where n is the size of the input and c is a constant.
	- Deterministic
		- P problems are deterministic, which means that they always produce the same output for the same input. This means that P problems can be solved by a deterministic algorithm.
	- Verifiable
		- P problems are verifiable, which means that the correctness of the output can be verified in polynomial time. This means that P problems can be solved by a deterministic algorithm that can check the correctness of the output.
- Some examples of P problems include:
	- Sorting: Sorting an array of numbers can be solved in polynomial time using algorithms such as merge sort or quicksort.
	- Searching: Searching for a specific element in an array can be solved in polynomial time using algorithms such as binary search.
	- Graph traversal: Traversing a graph can be solved in polynomial time using algorithms such as depth-first search or breadth-first search.
