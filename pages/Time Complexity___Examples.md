- common [[Time Complexity]] examples are shown below
- O(1)
	- Constant time algorithms: These algorithms take the same amount of time to execute, regardless of the size of the input. Some examples of constant time algorithms include:
		- Accessing an element in an array
		- Incrementing a variable
		- Performing a simple mathematical operation
- O(\log n)
	- Logarithmic time algorithms: These algorithms take time that is proportional to the logarithm of the size of the input. Some examples of logarithmic time algorithms include:
		- Binary search
		- Finding the smallest element in a sorted array
		- Finding the largest prime factor of a number
- O(n)
	- Linear time algorithms: These algorithms take time that is proportional to the size of the input. Some examples of linear time algorithms include:
		- Sorting an array using bubble sort
