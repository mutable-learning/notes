- Tractable problems are problems that can be solved in a reasonable amount of time and space.
- Tractable problems have a time complexity of one ofâ†“
	- $O(1)$
	- $O(\log n)$
	- $O(n)$
	- $O(n \log n)$
	- $O(n^2)$
- Intractable problems are problems that cannot be solved in a reasonable amount of time and space.
- Intractable problems have a time complexity of one of
	- $O(2^n)$
	- $O(n!)$
	- $O(n^n)$
- Here is an example of a tractable problem:
	- The problem of finding the shortest path between two points in a grid graph is tractable. This is because there is an algorithm, called Dijkstra's algorithm, that can solve the problem in polynomial time.
- Here is an example of an intractable problem:
	- The problem of determining whether a given graph is 3-colorable is intractable. This is because there is no algorithm that can solve the problem in polynomial time.
- For intractable problems, the time it takes to solve the problem grows exponentially with the size of the input. For example, the problem of finding the shortest path between two points in a graph is an intractable problem (for most types of graphs).
- Intractable problems are important because they arise in many different areas of computer science. For example, they are used in cryptography, scheduling, and artificial intelligence. Intractable problems also have implications for the future of computing. If we cannot find efficient ways to solve intractable problems, then there are some problems that will never be solved by computers.
- Tractability is different from the Decidability
