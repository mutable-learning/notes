- *Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city?*
	- NP-hard problem
- a variation of this to become decision problem is *Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, is there a route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city in no more than K cost?*
	- NP-complete problem
	- sometimes referred to as the TSP decision problem
	- this version is more difficult to solve than the NP-hard version of the TSP
