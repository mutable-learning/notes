-
- "Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city?"
	- NP-hard problem
- The problem can also be modified to "Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, is there a route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city in less than $d$ distance?"
	- NP-complete problem
	- sometimes referred to as the TSP decision problem
	- this version is more difficult to solve than the NP-hard version of the TSP
