- Trees share many of the same [[Graph Properties]], but also have their own as well
- Tree
	- is a connected, undirected acyclic [[Graph]]
	- represents a hierarchical structure with a set of connected nodes
	- each node can be connected to many children
	- each node can only be connected to one parent (except the root node)
	- each child node can become the root node of its own subtree (the node and all its descendants)
- Nodes
	- represent the objects or vertices in a tree
	- may contain data values
	- have a connection to one parent node (except root node) with a link
	- may connect to zero or more child nodes with links
- Root node
	- is the topmost node in a tree with no parent node
- Link
	- connects nodes together
	- also known as an edge
	- can be associated with a value, such as a weight
- Child nodes
	- are linked nodes below a node
- Neighbour node
	- a parent or child of the node
- Ancestor nodes
	- are nodes above a node, such as a parent's parent node
	- reachable by repeatedly moving from child to parent nodes
- Descendent nodes
	- are nodes below a node, such as a child's child
	- reachable by repeatedly moving from parent to child
	- also known as subchild nodes
- Sibling nodes
	- are nodes with the same parent, ordered from left to right
- Branch node
	- is any node that has child nodes
	- also called an internal node, inner node or inode
- Leaf node
	- is any node that has no children
	- also called an external node, outer node or terminal node
- Degree
	- for a given node this is its number of children
	- leaf nodes have degree zero
- Height
	- is the length of the longest downward path from the node to a leaf node.
- Depth
	- is the length of the path from the node to its root node
- Degree of tree
	- is the maximum degree of a node in the tree
- Distance
	- is the number of links between two nodes along the shortest path
- Level
	- is the number of links between it and the root node
- Width
	- the number of nodes in a level
- Breadth
	- the number of leaves
- Ordered tree
	- each node's children has a specified order
- Forest
	- a set of one or more isolated trees
