- An [[MST]]
	- applies to weighted, connected [[Graph]]
	- is a [[Tree]] , so has no cycles that contains all nodes in the graph
	- is a subset of the [[Graph]] containing all nodes
	- is a [[Tree]] that connects all nodes with the minimum distance possible
	- There can be multiple MSTs in a [[Graph]]
