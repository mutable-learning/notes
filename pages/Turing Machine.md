- A Turing machine is a mathematical model of computation, invented by Alan Turing in 1936, and it is still used today as a theoretical tool for studying the limits of computation.
- A Turing machine is a hypothetical machine that consists of
	- A tape: An infinitely long strip of tape divided into cells.
	- A head: A device that can read and write symbols on the tape.
	- A finite state control: A device that stores the machine's current state and determines its next state based on the symbol it is reading and its current state.
- The Turing machine works by
	- reading a symbol from the tape
	- changing its state
	- then writing a new symbol on the tape
	- the machine continues to do this until it reaches a halting state
- The halting state is a state in which the machine no longer changes its state or writes new symbols on the tape. A Turing machine can be said to be "computing" a function if it always enters a halting state for every possible input.
- Turing machines are a powerful model of computation. They can be used to simulate any computer program, and they can be used to solve any problem that can be solved by a computer.
- The history of Turing machines is closely tied to the history of computer science. Turing machines were first introduced in 1936, and they quickly became a popular tool for studying the limits of computation.
- Turing machines are still used today as a theoretical tool for studying the limits of computation. They are also used in the design of real-world computers. For example, the operation of the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer can be modelled by a Turing machine.
- Here are some of the key features of a Turing machine:
	- It is a theoretical model of computation.
	- It is a finite state machine.
	- It has an infinitely long tape.
	- It can read and write symbols on the tape.
	- It can change its state based on the symbol it is reading.
	- It can halt in a finite number of steps.
