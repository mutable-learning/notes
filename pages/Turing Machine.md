-
- is a mathematical model of computation, invented by Alan Turing in 1936, and it is still used today as a theoretical tool for studying the limits of computation
- is a hypothetical machine that consists of
	- tape
		- an infinitely long strip of tape divided into cells
	- head
		- a device that can read and write symbols on the tape
	- finite state control
		- A device that
			- stores the machine's current state
			- determines its next state based on the symbol it is reading and its current state
- works by
	- reading a symbol from the tape
	- changing its state
	- optionally writing a new symbol on the tape
	- moving to the left or right to a new cell
	- the machine continues to do this until it reaches a halting state
- halting state
	- is a state in which the machine no longer changes its state or writes new symbols on the tape
	- a Turing machine can be said to be "computing" a function if it always enters a halting state for every possible input
- can be used to simulate any computer program
- can be used to solve any problem that can be solved by a computer
- are still used today as a theoretical tool for studying the limits of computation
- are also used in the design of real-world computers
	- the operation of the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer can be modelled by a Turing machine
- Turing Machine features
	- is a theoretical model of computation
	- is a finite state machine
	- has an infinitely long tape
	- can read and write symbols on the tape
	- can change its state based on the symbol it is reading
	- can move along the tape in either direction as directed by the finite state control
	- can halt in a finite number of steps
