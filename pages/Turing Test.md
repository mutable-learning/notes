- The Turing test is a test of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behaviour equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human.
- It was introduced by Alan Turing in his 1950 paper, "Computing Machinery and Intelligence".
- The Turing test is conducted as follows
	- A human interrogator engages in natural language conversations with two other parties: a human and a machine designed to generate human-like responses.
	- The interrogator is aware that one of the two partners in conversation is a machine, and all participants are separated from one another.
	- The interrogator's goal is to determine which of the two partners is the machine.
	- If the interrogator cannot reliably tell the machine from the human, the machine is said to have passed the Turing test.
- Criticisms of the test include
	- that it is too anthropocentric or is biased towards human intelligence.
	- that it is too easy for a machine to game the test by simply memorizing a large amount of text.
- A brief history of the Turing test:
	- 1950: Alan Turing publishes his paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence", in which he introduces the Turing test.
	- 1966: Joseph Weizenbaum creates ELIZA, a computer program that simulates a Rogerian therapist. ELIZA is often cited as the first program to pass the Turing test, although this is disputed.
	- 1997: The Loebner Prize is founded, an annual competition for the computer program that can best pass the Turing test.
	- 2014: The chatbot named Eugene Goostman claimed to have passed the Turing test at a contest in Russia, but this claim was later disputed.
	- 2022: The chatbot named LaMDA (Language Model for Dialogue Applications) created by Google AI claims to have passed the Turing test. However, this claim has not been independently verified.
- The Turing test remains an important benchmark for artificial intelligence research.
- It is a simple and intuitive way to measure a machine's ability to communicate and reason like a human.
- As artificial intelligence research continues to advance, it is likely that the Turing test will become even more important.
