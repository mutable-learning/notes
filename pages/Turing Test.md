- is a test of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behaviour equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human
- was introduced by Alan Turing in his 1950 paper, "Computing Machinery and Intelligence"
- is an arguably simple and intuitive way to measure a machine's ability to communicate and reason like a human
- conducted as follows
	- a human interrogator engages in natural language conversations with two other parties
		- a human
		- a machine designed to generate human-like responses
	- the interrogator is aware that one of the two partners in conversation is a machine, and all participants are separated from one another
		- in some versions the interrogator is not aware
	- the interrogator's goal is to determine which of the two partners is the machine
	- If the interrogator cannot reliably tell the machine from the human, the machine is said to have passed the Turing test
- criticisms of the test include
	- that it is too anthropocentric or is biased towards human intelligence
	- that it is too easy for a machine to game the test by simply memorizing a large amount of text
- [[Searle's Chinese Room Argument]] was developed as a refutation that passing the Turing Test demonstrates [[AI]]
