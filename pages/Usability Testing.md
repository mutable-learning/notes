-
- is a type of [[UX]] research that evaluates how easy and efficient it is for users to complete tasks using a solution
- is typically conducted by having users perform specific tasks while observers watch, listen, and take notes
- the focus of the usability test should be the user and their experience
- the goals of the testing are
	- to identify any usability problems
	- collect qualitative and quantitative data
	- determine participant's satisfaction with the solution
- Usability Testing steps
	- gather participants
		- should be representative of the target users for the solution
	- develop tasks
		- create a list of tasks (*script*) that each user will be asked to complete
		- tasks should be representative of ones a real-world user would perform using the solution
	- conduct the test
		- usually in a setting that is similar to normal solution usage
		- observer takes notes, watches and listens to feedback
	- analyse results
		- gather data and create identify problems
		- determine a list of suggested fixes
	- report results
		- provide the testing data to the developers who can then plan for changes to the solution
- is an important part of the [[Testing Strategy]] and should happen before the solution is released
