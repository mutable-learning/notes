-
- refers to how easy and efficient it is for users to achieve their goals with the software
- a measure of how well the software meets the needs of its users
- if a software product is not usable, users may be frustrated and abandon it
	- can lead to lost productivity and revenue for the company that developed the software

	- unusable software can be dangerous, especially in safety-critical applications
- Usability influences
	- User Interface
		- the part of the software that users interact with directly
		- should be well-designed and easy to use, with clear and concise instructions
	- Functionality
		- be able to do what users need it to do
		- should also be easy to learn and use
		- should not be too complex
	- Performance
		- software should run smoothly and efficiently
		- should be responsive to user input
	- Reliability
		- software should be reliable and bug-free
		- should be able to trust that the software will work as expected
- Usability focus in design
	- conduct user research
		- understand the needs and expectations of the users of the software
		- can be done through user interviews, surveys, and usability testing
	- user-centered design principles
		- a design philosophy that focuses on the needs of the user throughout the design process
		- involving users in the design process and getting feedback from them on prototypes and early versions of the software
	- using design patterns
		- reusable solutions to common design problems
		- are a number of design patterns that can be used to improve the usability of software, such as navigation patterns, form patterns, and feedback patterns
	- user testing
		- test the software with users early and often in the development process
		- will help to identify any usability problems and make sure that the software is easy to use
- usability of a solution is evaluated through a [[Usability Testing]] process as part of the solution's [[Testing Strategy]]
