-
- is a system of tracking changes to a collection of files over time
- is an essential part of any software development project
	- allows developers to collaborate on code, track changes, and revert to previous versions if necessary
- is not meant to be a [[Backup and Recovery]] tool, but it can be used to recover changes made to text files, such as source code
- Version Control benefits
	- Collaboration
		- allows developers to collaborate on code by sharing the repository
		- makes it easy for developers to work on the same files at the same time
	- Tracking changes
		- tracks all changes to the files in the repository
			- see who made what changes and when
	- Reverting to previous versions
		- if a developer makes a mistake or if a change causes a problem,Â they can easily revert to a previous version of the file
	- Branching and merging
		- allows developers to create branches of the codebase
			- allows developers to experiment with new features or to fix bugs without affecting the main codebase
		- branches can then be merged back into the main codebase when they are ready
