-
- is a simple and easy-to-use methodology that can be effective for small and well-defined projects
- is a sequential methodology
	- has a linear approach
	- each stage of the [[Problem-solving Methodology]] is fully completed before the next begins
		- there is no going back and making changes to a stage once another stage has started
- each stage has its own section or is a sub-plan of the overall [[Project Plan]]
- good for projects that are small or have very well defined specifications
- Waterfall Model advantages
	- simple and easy to understand
		- is a sequential model, which means that it is easy to understand and implement
	- well-defined stages and deliverables
		- each stages of the waterfall model has specific deliverables
		- easy to track progress and identify any potential problems early on
	- easy to manage
		- is a highly structured methodology
		- makes it easy to manage and control
	- predictable costs and timelines
		- due to the well-defined phases and deliverables, the waterfall model can help to predict costs and timelines more accurately
- Waterfall Model disadvantages
	- inflexible
		- is a rigid methodology
		- makes it difficult to make changes to the project requirements once the development process has begun
	- high risk
		- if there is a problem with one phase of the waterfall model it can delay or even derail the entire project
	- low customer involvement
		- does not involve the customer much during the development process
		- can lead to a product that does not meet their needs
	- unsuitable for complex and changing projects
		- is not well-suited for complex or rapidly changing projects
		- it can be difficult to accurately define all of the requirements at the beginning of the project
