-
- uses eXtensible Markup Language to encode the data stored within the file
- is a [[Text file]] that follows the XML standard to define structure and formatting of the data in the file
- different versions of XML support different features
	- files should specify which version of XML they support
- data is stored with the structure to make it easy to share between systems
	- the data is readable by humans
	- the structure helps with understanding the data
	- the structure is tree-based with a root element and child elements that form a parent-child relationship
- each element in the tree can have attributes that describe the element, along with the data
- each element, or tag, is defined using it in the file
	- there are no default tags only the ones used
- the user defines the tags, the tree structure, the attributes and the parent-child relationships by creating them in the file
- is an industry standard format in wide use
- sets rules that the data must follow within the file in a consistent and standard manner
- useful for cross-platform and cross-application data transfer
- consistency and use of standards helps to ensure [[Data Integrity]]
